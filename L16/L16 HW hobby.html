            <p>video games are not the things that some may put as there Hobbies but to me it is one.
               Because its all about the games and the people that u play with that makes the fun more 
               fun and more intaractive some of my friend whitch I live play with me the game that we all
               can play for example, call of duty or Efootball which brings out a form of competition between
               all of us

            <span class="badge badge-light">My 2<sup>nd</sup> Hobby: playing football</span>
            <p>My hobby is playing football because, it's not just a sport played played by people in a small field.
               but a sport that brout together many countries. foot ball was once played by soldgers when they finished wars.
               It motivates me to also play the game to be able to keep the almost forgoten spirit by most of the 
               once who used to protect the countries that we all live in. It also helps breings enemys to be friends,
               because u might find out that he is in the same team as you and you may help each other to stratagise plans
                for the next upcoming games.
